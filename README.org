** =data/list_info.csv=

This file has information about the compositions of the four stimulus lists used in the experiment.

| Field     | Description                              |
|-----------+------------------------------------------|
| =ListID=  | ID of stimulus list (1--4)               |
| =ItemID=  | ID of stimulus item                      |
| =BlockID= | Unique block identifier                  |
| =BTrial=  | Trial number within a given block        |
| =Audio=   | Name of audio stimulus file              |
| =Type=    | Was it a 'test' trial or 'filler' trial? |

NB: main data presented in the report was from 'test' trials, not 'filler' trials.

** =data/mouse.csv=

File containing mouse cursor positions for each trial (including fillers).

| Field     | Description                                      |
|-----------+--------------------------------------------------|
| =TrialID= | Unique trial identifier (see =data/trials.csv=)  |
| =Msec=    | Timestamp of mouse cursor reading (milliseconds) |
| =X=       | Horizontal cursor position                       |
| =Y=       | Vertical cursor position                         |

- Cursor positions are defined relative to a screen with 1024x768
  resolution, where (0, 0) is the top left corner.

- Timestamps are defined relative to the onset of the trial (0 ms).
  Need to get information from =data/test_info.csv= to time-lock mouse
  data to the speech stimulus.

** =data/screens.csv=

| =bitmap=   | Name of bitmap file                                   |
| =x1=       | left edge                                             |
| =y1=       | top edge                                              |
| =x2=       | right edge                                            |

| =identity= | was the stimulus target or not                        |

Information about the screen locations of the two bitmaps associated with a given stimulus identifier (=ItemID=).

- All x, y values are in pixels (see =data/mouse.csv=)

| Gender    | Gender of participant                      |
| ListID    | stimulus list presented to the participant |

Information about each experimental session, including participant gender and stimulus list identifier.

** =data/test_info.csv=

| Field       | Description                                 |

| =NPoffset=  | Offset of the noun phrase (milliseconds)    |
| =FillPause= | Filled pause condition ("um" or "baseline") |
| =Spkr=      | Speaker condition ("same" or "diff")        |

Information about each 'test' trial, including condition information for the two main independent variables (=FillPause= and =Spkr=).

** =data/trials.csv=

| Field       | Description                                     |

- =ClickMs= is measured relative to the onset of the trial (0 ms)



* Reproducing the analyses

Use =dist_from_target.R= to recreate Figure 2 from the paper.

Use =main_analysis.R= to reproduce Table 1 and perform inferential stats (using ANOVA, not t-test on difference scores as in paper).
